This is my first attempt to create the google homepage using html, css, and Chrome developer tools. 
I'll be putting to test the knowledge I've gained in the last few weeks of starting The Odin Project. 
This is the assigment from From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

Building this has helped me develop a stronger appreciation of the body of information available on the Internet and how you could get valuable insights by using the right search terms.

Note to self - Don't give up.
